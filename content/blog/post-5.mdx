# Optimizing Web Performance in 2024

Performance optimization is crucial for user experience and SEO. Here are modern techniques to improve your website's speed.

## Code Splitting

Code splitting allows you to split your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks, loading only what's needed for each page.

### Dynamic Imports

Use dynamic imports to lazy load components:

```javascript
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>
});
```

## Image Optimization

Modern image optimization techniques:

- **Next.js Image Component**: Automatic optimization and lazy loading
- **WebP Format**: Better compression than JPEG/PNG
- **Responsive Images**: Serve appropriately sized images for different devices
- **Lazy Loading**: Load images as they enter the viewport

## Bundle Analysis

Regularly analyze your bundle size:

```bash
npm run build -- --analyze
```

Identify and remove unused dependencies or large libraries.

## Caching Strategies

Implement effective caching:

- **Browser Caching**: Set appropriate cache headers
- **CDN Caching**: Use a CDN for static assets
- **Service Workers**: Implement offline-first strategies
- **API Response Caching**: Cache API responses when appropriate

## Minimizing Render Blocking

Reduce render-blocking resources:

- Inline critical CSS
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Use async/defer attributes for scripts
- Optimize font loading with `font-display: swap`

## Database Optimization

For full-stack applications:

- Use database indexes effectively
- Implement query optimization
- Consider database connection pooling
- Use caching layers (Redis, Memcached)

## Monitoring Performance

Use performance monitoring tools:

- **Lighthouse**: Built into Chrome DevTools
- **WebPageTest**: Detailed performance analysis
- **Real User Monitoring**: Track actual user experience
- **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor LCP, FID, and CLS metrics

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an ongoing process. Start with the biggest wins (images, code splitting) and gradually optimize other areas. Measure before and after to validate improvements.
