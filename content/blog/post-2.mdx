# Mastering TypeScript in React

TypeScript brings type safety to React development, helping catch errors early and improving code maintainability.

## Why TypeScript in React?

TypeScript offers several benefits:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete and IntelliSense
- **Improved Refactoring**: Safe refactoring with confidence
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Types serve as inline documentation

## Setting Up TypeScript with React

To add TypeScript to an existing React project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
```

Then create a `tsconfig.json` file with appropriate settings for React.

## Typing Components

Here's how to type a functional component:

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick, disabled = false }) => {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled}>
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};
```

## Advanced Patterns

TypeScript enables powerful patterns like discriminated unions, generics, and conditional types that make React code more robust and flexible.

## Best Practices

- Use interfaces for component props
- Leverage TypeScript's utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`)
- Avoid using `any` - use `unknown` when the type is truly unknown
- Utilize React's built-in types like `React.ReactNode` and `React.MouseEvent`

## Conclusion

TypeScript and React work beautifully together. Start with basic types and gradually adopt more advanced patterns as your project grows.
