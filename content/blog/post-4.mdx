# CSS Grid vs Flexbox: When to Use What

Understanding when to use CSS Grid versus Flexbox is crucial for creating effective layouts.

## The Fundamental Difference

**Flexbox** is designed for one-dimensional layouts (either rows or columns), while **CSS Grid** is designed for two-dimensional layouts (both rows and columns simultaneously).

## When to Use Flexbox

Flexbox excels at:

- **Component Layout**: Navigation bars, buttons, cards
- **Aligning Items**: Centering content, distributing space
- **Flexible Sizing**: Items that grow or shrink based on available space
- **Single-Direction Layouts**: Either horizontal or vertical, not both

## When to Use CSS Grid

CSS Grid is ideal for:

- **Page Layout**: Overall page structure with headers, sidebars, and footers
- **Complex 2D Layouts**: Items that need precise placement in both dimensions
- **Overlapping Elements**: When you need items to overlap or layer
- **Responsive Grids**: Creating responsive grid-based layouts

## Combining Both

The best approach is often to use both:

- Use **Grid** for the overall page layout
- Use **Flexbox** for the components within grid areas

This combines the strengths of both layout systems.

## Example: Navigation Bar

Flexbox is perfect for navigation bars:

```css
.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## Example: Dashboard Layout

Grid works well for dashboard layouts:

```css
.dashboard {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  grid-template-areas:
    "sidebar header"
    "sidebar main"
    "sidebar footer";
}
```

## Browser Support

Both Grid and Flexbox have excellent modern browser support. Flexbox has slightly better legacy browser support, but Grid is supported in all modern browsers.

## Conclusion

Choose Flexbox for component-level one-dimensional layouts, and CSS Grid for page-level two-dimensional layouts. Don't be afraid to use both together!
