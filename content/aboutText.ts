export const aboutDescription = `I love building software that works beautifully from end to end — from intuitive frontends to robust, scalable backend systems. As a full-stack developer, I enjoy connecting product thinking with solid engineering foundations to create systems that are reliable, maintainable, and built to scale.

Outside of work, I’m constantly exploring and experimenting. Whether it’s solving LeetCode problems, diving into system design concepts, building side projects, or writing technical blog posts, I’m always sharpening my craft. 

For me, software engineering isn’t just a career path — it’s a craft I’m committed to improving every day.`
