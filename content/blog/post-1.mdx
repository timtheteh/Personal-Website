# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 introduces the App Router, which provides a powerful new way to build React applications. This tutorial will guide you through the fundamentals.

## What's New in Next.js 14?

The App Router brings several exciting features:

- **Server Components**: Build faster applications with server-side rendering by default
- **Streaming**: Improve performance with streaming SSR and Suspense
- **Layouts**: Share UI between routes while preserving state
- **Loading States**: Built-in loading UI with the `loading.js` file

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js 14 project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new project with the latest features and best practices.

## Understanding the App Router

The App Router uses a file-system based routing system. Each folder in the `app` directory represents a route segment, and special files like `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` define the UI for that segment.

## Conclusion

Next.js 14's App Router makes building modern web applications easier and more intuitive. Start exploring these features in your next project!
