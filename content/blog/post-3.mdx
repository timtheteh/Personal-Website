# Building 3D Experiences with Three.js

Three.js opens up a world of possibilities for creating immersive 3D experiences on the web.

## Introduction to Three.js

Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. It provides an intuitive API for creating scenes, cameras, lights, and 3D objects.

## Getting Started

Install Three.js and React Three Fiber:

```bash
npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
```

React Three Fiber provides React bindings for Three.js, making it easy to use in React applications.

## Creating Your First Scene

A basic Three.js scene consists of:

- **Scene**: The container for all objects
- **Camera**: Defines the viewpoint
- **Renderer**: Draws the scene
- **Light**: Illuminates the objects
- **Mesh**: The 3D objects themselves

## Working with React Three Fiber

React Three Fiber allows you to use JSX to describe 3D scenes:

```jsx
<Canvas>
  <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
  <directionalLight position={[10, 10, 5]} />
  <mesh>
    <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
    <meshStandardMaterial color="orange" />
  </mesh>
</Canvas>
```

## Advanced Techniques

Explore advanced features like:

- Loading 3D models (GLTF, FBX, OBJ)
- Animations and transitions
- Physics integration
- Post-processing effects
- Virtual reality support

## Performance Optimization

Optimize your 3D scenes by:

- Using instancing for repeated objects
- Implementing level-of-detail (LOD)
- Culling objects outside the camera view
- Optimizing texture sizes
- Using efficient lighting models

## Conclusion

Three.js enables developers to create stunning 3D web experiences. Start simple and gradually explore more complex features as you build your skills.
